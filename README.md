# Simple-weather-app-with-a-user-interface-


This is Simple Weather App with A user Interface 
This software is developed by me using Python. 
This simple software uses a encryption for the API key, since this is public and just to showcase my talents, I am going to replace the Key using comment where to insert the API key.
If you want to try you can add your own Key by signing up on Open weather.
There is a main file, a encryption file and another to run unit test on the app. 
feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
